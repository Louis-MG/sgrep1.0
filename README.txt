From the doc.html file:

Sgrep (sorted grep) searches sorted input files for lines that
match a search key and outputs the matching lines.
When searching large files sgrep is much faster
than traditional Unix grep, but with significant restrictions.

On my equipment, sgrep searches 13GB of sorted text with over 500 million lines in just a few 1/1000ths of a second.
